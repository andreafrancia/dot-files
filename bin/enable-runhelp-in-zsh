#!/bin/zsh

# Zsh as-is does not provide a simple way to display a contextual help for its
# builtin commmands. This script enable you to access to builtin help simply
# writing the plugin name and pressing ALT+H or ESC+H (both shortcuts works).

# The directory ~/.zsh_help will contain the help description for each builtin
# command.

mkdir -p ~/.zsh_help
cd ~/.zsh_help

# Building the commands helps files.
#
# In the system a manpage that contains the manual for *all* Zsh builtins
# commands already exists.

manpage=zshbuiltins

# The contents of that manpage has to be splitted-out in individual files, one
# file for each builtin. This can be accomplished with

splitting_command="man $manpage | colcrt - | perl helpfiles"

# Where:
#   - `colcrt` is a standard BSD utility that strip out screen control
#     characters (like those that make text brighter or underlined)
#   - `helpfiles` is a perl script that does the splitting.

# The `helpfile` script is distributed with the Zsh sources, but homebrew will
# not install it, so we have to download it:

curl -ohelpfiles 'http://zsh.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=zsh/zsh;a=blob_plain;f=Util/helpfiles;hb=HEAD'

# once downloaded we can finally run the afore-defined splitting command:

$splitting_command

# At this point we should have created several files under .zsh_help one for
# each Zsh builtin.

# Now we tell to the user how to finalize the configuration.
