Ctags
=====

You need ctags, they suggest to use the Exuberant Ctags version which has 
support for many languages (and one of these is Python). The exuberant ctags 
main page is hosted on sourceforge: http://ctgas.sf.net and you can install it 
with brew:

    brew install ctags

To prepare tags:

    cd <your-project-dir> 
    ctags --python-kinds=-i --exclude=build -R .

The `--python-kinds=-i` purpose is to disable the recognition of import lines 
as definition that could be annoying.

How to use it:
 - vim -t <tag name> to open vim straight on the tag
 - Ctrl+] to jump to tag when over a word
 - Ctrl+T to pop back
 - :tselect or :stselect to open
 - :tnext, :tprev to go to next/prev tag finding
